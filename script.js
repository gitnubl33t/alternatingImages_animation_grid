/*  NOTES FROM JEN -
Once again, because Grid allows overlapping cells, you can do all kinds of interesting layout and special effects.

Here, I've used Grid to stack two figures on top of each other. Stacking may be controlled via z-index.

Then I used some simple CSS animation to fade the top kitten in and out. 

The keyframes are set up to show the image as is 25% of the interval, fade from one image to the other between 25-75% of the time interval, and show the last image the final 25% of the interval. Then the animation rocks back the other way to fade in the kitten again.
